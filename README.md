Localization for Steve's Carts 2. Interested in translating the mod into your language, then follow the basic instruction below.


How to translate the mod

1) Pull the en_Us.lang file

2) Rename it to match your language. If you're not sure what the name should be, take a look at the lang files of minecraft and use the same name.

3) Translate all the entries to your language


CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE (you need beta 2 which hasn't been released yet)

4) Put your lang file in the lang folder of Steve's Carts (if it's not there already)

5) Run minecraft, swap to your language and see if it look good.



6) Make a pull request to this repository (github.com/Vswe/SC2_lang/) to submit your changes.
